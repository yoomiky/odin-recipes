    <p>This coconut rice is perfect! I tried many different ways to duplicate my favorite restaurant's coconut rice after they went out of business. Garnish with toasted coconut and chopped cilantro if you like.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups uncooked jasmine rice</li> 
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can light or full-fat coconut milk, well shaken and stirred</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>      
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place rice in a fine mesh strainer, and rinse with cold water, stirring rice using your fingers to remove excess starch, until water from rice runs clear, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Place rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan; stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture in saucepan to a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, undisturbed, for 11 minutes. Turn off heat; steam, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncover and gently stir in coconut oil.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
